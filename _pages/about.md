# Research Interest

- Tactile Perception & Force Sensing
- Modeling and Manipulation of Deformable Objects
- Applied Machine Learning

My current research focuses on the modeling, perception and manipulation of deformable objects, aiming to make it robust, practical, and easy-to-apply. In addition, I’m broadly interested in force sensing, and tactile perception with their applications to robotic dexterous manipulation of various objects.

In a word, advanced technologies like robotics and  ML positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
