The [Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition - In-Hand Manipulation Track](https://cse.usf.edu/~yusun/rgmc/2024.html) is focused on reconfiguring objects in robot dexterous hands. The competition tasks focus on two essential skills: in-hand precise manipulation and in-hand object re-orientation. Our solution involving an open-sourced Leap Hand, trajectory optimization, and reinforcement learning won the 1st place of the in-hand manipulation competition, and also won the Most Elegant Solution Award among all tracks in the RGMC.

Most research on deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation assumes rigid grasping. However, beyond rigid grasping and re-grasping, in-hand following is also an essential skill that humans use to dexterously manipulate DLOs. In this work, inspired by how humans use fingers to follow DLOs, we explore the usage of a generic dexterous hand with tactile sensing to imitate human skills and achieve robust in-hand DLO following. To enable the hardware system to function in the real world, we develop a framework that includes Cartesian-space arm-hand control, tactile-based in-hand 3-D DLO pose estimation, and task-specific motion design.

This article focuses on the global moving and shaping of DLOs in constrained environments by dual-arm robots. The main objectives are 1) to efficiently and accurately accomplish this task, and 2) to achieve generalizable and robust manipulation of various DLOs.
To this end, we propose a complementary framework with whole-body planning and control using appropriate DLO model representations.
Experiments demonstrate that our framework can accomplish considerably more complicated tasks than existing works. It achieves a 100% planning success rate among thousands of trials with an average time cost of less than 15 second, and a 100% manipulation success rate among 135 real-world tests on five different DLOs.

Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) to
achieve desired shapes in constrained environments with obstacles is a meaningful but challenging task. We propose a coarse-to-fine framework to combine global planning and local control for dual-arm manipulation of DLOs, capable of precisely achieving desired configurations and avoiding potential collisions between the DLO, robot, and obstacles. Both simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework can robustly achieve desired DLO configurations in constrained environments with imprecise DLO models, which may not be reliably achieved by only planning or control.

## Learning to Estimate 3-D States of Deformable Linear Objects from Occluded Single-Frame Point Clouds

We focus on learning to robustly estimate the states
of DLOs from single-frame point clouds in the presence of
occlusions using a data-driven method. Simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate
that our method can generate globally smooth and locally
precise DLO state estimation results even with heavily occluded point clouds, which can be directly applied to real-world robotic manipulation of DLOs in 3-D space. -->
